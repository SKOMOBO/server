setup ways to test both production server and local using artillery and super test, both with and without database connection,

make a test database that it connects to that stores dud data keep normal for real data

local data is fine just for production.

maybe can use production db just need to be able to reset auto increment index and delete all the test data

ask ITS if I may do a load test before conducting one to ensure that they are ready

keymetrics make sure typescript compiles might need to  be post pull hook or something
